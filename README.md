## TODO:
[ ] Replace `panic!` with modal when required
[ ] Do heavy refactor-ing

## Known bug(s):
### 1: When tried to change hostname without required privileges, error is shown. After pressing **Got it**. It correctly focuses MainMenu, but none of the submenus are focused after that.

### Solution: [Unsure] Change the implementation of **ErrorModal**.
